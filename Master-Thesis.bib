  abstract = {Real-time detection of humans is an evolutionary research topic. It is an essential and prominent component of various vision based applications. Detection of humans in real-time video sequences is an arduous and challenging task due to various constraints like cluttered environment, occlusion, noise, etc. Many researchers are doing their research in this area and have published the number of researches so far. Determining humans in visual monitoring system is prominent for different types of applications like person detection and identification, fall detection for an elder person, abnormal surveillance, gender classification, crowd analysis, person gait characterization, etc. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the various challenges and modern developments seen for human detection methodologies in day vision. This paper consists of an overview of different human detection techniques and their classification based on various underlying factors. The algorithmic technicalities with their applicability to these techniques are deliberated in detail in the manuscript. Different humanitarian imperative factors have also been highlighted for comparative analysis of each human detection methodology. Our survey shows the difference between current research and future requirements.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most significant networks in the deep learning field. Since CNN made impressive achievements in many areas, including but not limited to computer vision and natural language processing, it attracted much attention both of industry and academia in the past few years. The existing reviews mainly focus on the applications of CNN in different scenarios without considering CNN from a general perspective, and some novel ideas proposed recently are not covered. In this review, we aim to provide novel ideas and prospects in this fast-growing field as much as possible. Besides, not only two-dimensional convolution but also one-dimensional and multi-dimensional ones are involved. First, this review starts with a brief introduction to the history of CNN. Second, we provide an overview of CNN. Third, classic and advanced CNN models are introduced, especially those key points making them reach state-of-the-art results. Fourth, through experimental analysis, we draw some conclusions and provide several rules of thumb for function selection. Fifth, the applications of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional convolution are covered. Finally, some open issues and promising directions for CNN are discussed to serve as guidelines for future work.},

  abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence technology is currently bringing about new opportunities in construction. Machine learning is a major area of interest within the field of artificial intelligence, playing a pivotal role in the process of making construction ``smart''. The application of machine learning in construction has the potential to open up an array of opportunities such as site supervision, automatic detection, and intelligent maintenance. However, the implementation of machine learning faces a range of challenges due to the difficulties in acquiring labeled data, especially when applied in a highly complex construction site environment. This paper reviews the history of machine learning development from shallow to deep learning and its applications in construction. The strengths and weaknesses of machine learning technology in construction have been analyzed in order to foresee the future direction of machine learning applications in this sphere. Furthermore, this paper presents suggestions which may benefit researchers in terms of combining specific knowledge domains in construction with machine learning algorithms so as to develop dedicated deep network models for the industry.},
